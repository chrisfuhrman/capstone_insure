	        <h3>Chris Fuhrman</h3>
	        <p>Chris has a strong background in business operations and enjoyed his work over the past 5 years.  However, he was drawn to the tech field for a variety of reasons and wanted to be able to create and build things - not just work at a tech company doing operations.  This led him to move from Philadelphia to San Antonio to attend Codeup's coding bootcamp.

			Chris thrived in Codeup's learning environment and can now function as a junior level programmer.  Chris is eager to start putting his skill to work. </p>

	        <p>In this modern age where the internet and software has saturated every aspect of our lives, I felt that I was lacking. Even though I have a background in banking and customer service, this did not satisfy my creative desire. When I heard about Codeup I jumpted on the opportunity to expand my potential because of how fast this industry is growing</p>

	        <p>I used to be a creative writing major before I learned about Codeup. I've always been interested in the arts of all kinds, I love literature and have taken many art, writing, and music classes. All of this has given me a better perspective on designing interfaces and working on making both front-end and back-end design harmonious for users. I love beautiful design and have used my beginner's skills to help make this website powerful and wonderful to look at, and I hope to have many more opportunities in the future to work with users first-hand in creating fantastic user experiences.l
